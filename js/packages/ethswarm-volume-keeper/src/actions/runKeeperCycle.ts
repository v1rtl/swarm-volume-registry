/**
 * One full keeper cycle: read the registry's active volumes and trigger them.
 *
 * **No client-side filtering.** Every Active volume goes into the batch and the
 * contract decides what each one needs. `_triggerOne` tops up only a real
 * deficit, retires a dead batch, and answers `TopupSkipped` when the payer
 * can't or won't pay — so a volume that needs nothing is a silent no-op costing
 * about 28k gas. Deciding that off-chain would only be saving gas, at the price
 * of a second opinion that can disagree with the chain.
 *
 * What actually happened is on the receipt: `toppedUp`, `retired`,
 * `topupSkipped`. Pass `dryRun` to simulate a whole cycle without sending
 * anything.
 *
 * **Never throws.** Every failure is folded into the returned result, because
 * throwing out of a cron handler causes retry storms. Check `ok`.
 *
 * Stateless and self-healing: nothing is remembered between cycles. If a
 * transaction does not mine, the result reports it (with its hash) and the next
 * cycle re-reads the chain. `trigger` is idempotent, so a late-mining
 * transaction tops up zero — which also makes it safe to run two keepers
 * concurrently for redundancy.
 *
 * The client must be able to both read and write — a wallet client extended
 * with `publicActions`.
 *
 * @example
 * const result = await runKeeperCycle(client, { registry: '0x…' })
