/**
 * One full keeper cycle: read the registry's active volumes and trigger each
 * one.
 *
 * **One transaction per volume**, per the v2 keeper convention in
 * docs/KEEPERS.md. The batched `trigger(bytes32[])` is cheaper but runs each id
 * inside the contract's own try/catch, where a gas shortfall is swallowed and
 * the transaction still succeeds — so a batched receipt cannot distinguish a
 * volume that needed nothing from one that was silently starved. Paying for N
 * transactions buys N unambiguous receipts, which is the thing a keeper exists
 * to produce.
 *
 * **No client-side filtering.** Every Active volume is triggered and the
 * contract decides what each one needs. `_triggerOne` tops up only a real
 * deficit, retires a dead batch, and answers `TopupSkipped` when the payer
 * can't or won't pay — so a volume that needs nothing is a no-op costing about
 * 28k gas. Deciding that off-chain would only be saving gas, at the price of a
 * second opinion that can disagree with the chain.
 *
 * **Volumes are processed sequentially**, and every one is attempted even after
 * an earlier one fails; `ok` then reports the run as failed and `failed` names
 * the volumes. Sequential is what keeps nonces safe without this package
 * managing them, and it is what bounds a cycle: `cycleTimeout` stops new
 * transactions rather than truncating one in flight, and anything left over is
 * warned about and picked up next cycle. A cycle therefore handles roughly
 * `cycleTimeout / confirmation time` volumes — size the schedule for that
 * against `graceBlocks`.
 *
 * **Never throws.** Every failure is folded into the returned result, because
 * throwing out of a cron handler causes retry storms. Check `ok`.
 *
 * Stateless and self-healing: nothing is remembered between cycles. If a
 * transaction does not mine, the result reports it (with its hash) and the next
 * cycle re-reads the chain. `trigger` is idempotent, so a late-mining
 * transaction tops up zero — which also makes it safe to run two keepers
 * concurrently for redundancy.
 *
 * The client must be able to both read and write — a wallet client extended
 * with `publicActions`.
 *
 * @example
 * const result = await runKeeperCycle(client, { registry: '0x…' })
